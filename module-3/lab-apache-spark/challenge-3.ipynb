    "\n",
    "But before we start the real work, we'd like you to get familiar with the concept of [benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)). Benchmarking is a common technique in software engineering and data engineering to evaluate the efficiency of your codes. The idea is to measure the execution time of your program and research if there is room to improve your code in order to get the job done with shorter time. In machine learning a lot of times you'be doing repeated sampling and complex queries that could run for hours, days, or even weeks. It is important that you improve your code efficiency whenever you can. Otherwise you'll waste a lot of time and computation powers in executing inefficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will benchmark a code snippet that estimates Pi (`π`) by repeated sampling. We will first benchmark this without using Spark. The idea of the Pi estimation is to randomly generate many points with `x` and `y` coordinates between 0 and 1. These points will fall in a square whose side length is 1 (the upper right grid of the square in the image below that combines the red and green areas). We will count the number of sample points that fall into the 1/4 circle sector (the area in red) against all points which allows us to calculate Pi.\n",

    "A0 = π * r^2\n",
    "A1 = (2r)^2\n",
    "```\n",

    "From the formulas above, you can deduce ` π = 4 * A0` if *r* is 1, which means Pi equals to 4 times the probability of a point falling into the red area.\n",

    "Because this lab focuses on Spark, we will provide you the code snippet for estimating Pi based on the mathematical concept discussed above. Read the code carefully and make sure you fully understand what the code does."

    "As you see, the excution time increases when you increase the sample size. In addition, the accuracy of the Pi value increases as you increase the sample size. But if you keep increasing the sample size you have to wait a long time for the script to finish execution. What can you do if you really need to run a very large sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options. You can **use a computer with higher processing speed**. This allows you to execute the sampling jobs faster. But this is usually not the best option because the improvement of CPU processing speed has limited impacts on executing millions of sampling jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is to **run multiple sampling jobs in parallel**. In case you don't know yet, Python is a linear programming language which means it executes one job then the next. If you wait for millions of samping jobs to finish in a single queue it will take you a lot of time. Therefore, most modern programming languages including Python and R have introduced a feature called [parallel programming or parallel processing](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing) so that you can save time by running several tasks at the same time. Say if your sampling jobs would take 1,000 seconds to finish in a single queue, you can finish them in 250 seconds with 4 parallel processing queues. Note that this time calculation is theoretical. In reality with 4 parallel queues the finishing time is usually more than 250 seconds because Python has to spend some overhead time to [spawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(computing)) the parallel processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many parallel processes you can run depends on how many CPU cores you have** on your computer. If you have 8 CPU cores on your computer, the max number of parallel processes you can run is 8. What if you attempt to run more processes than the number of your CPU cores? The excessive jobs will be queued up in the same CPU core which makes your parallel programming meaningless. Therefore, in order to run parallel programming you need to use a multi-core computer and the parallel processes can't exceed your number of CPU cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you may ask, **should I allocate all my CPU cores to parallel programming?** Remember that besides executing the parallel programming scripts, your computer's CPUs also need to run your operation system and some other system processes. Therefore, **you typically reserve 1-2 CPU cores for the OS and system processes and allocate the rest to parallel programming**. However, with Apache Spark you don't need to manually allocate the CPU cores because Spark will automatically do that for you depending on how many cores it has access to. Remember in Challenge 2 we asked you to use the following command to start Spark:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$SPARK_PATH/bin/pyspark --master \"local[*]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*` directive tells Sparks to decide how many CPU cores to use by itself. If you start Spark with `local[2]`, it means you allocate 2 CPU cores to Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note is **your computer memory may also set a bottleneck on the performance of parallel programming**. When your computer runs parallel jobs, its memory consumption is multiplied. If a single process consumes 256mb memory, four parallel processes will consume 1,024mb memory. This is in addition to the memory consumption of Apache Spark that keeps your dataset in the memory to improve processing speed. Therefore, in order to use Spark successfully in local mode, you really need a high-end computer with multi-cores and high memory (8gb or above). If your computer runs out of memory, your parallel scripts will be shut down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed the multi-core and memory concerns of running Spark in the local mode. These concerns are similar if you run Spark in the cluster mode. With the cluster mode each cluster has its own memory and one or multiple cores. Spark is smart enough to automatically allocate the resources in the cluster mode too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move on to the real stuff. How do you run parallel programming with Apache Spark? **That is achieved by invoking Spark's `parallelize` method** ([documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#parallelized-collections)). In the next cell, we have a function called `estimate_pi_parallel` for you to complete. You will rewrite the `estimate_pi` function we gave you earlier and use `SparkContext.parallelize` to spawn parallel processes to create the random point samples then use the samples to estimate Pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are stuck, you can reference [this Jupyter Notebook example](https://github.com/mGalarnyk/Installations_Mac_Ubuntu_Windows/blob/master/Spark/Estimating%20PI.ipynb) (but don't simply copy and paste). **Make sure to benchmark your function so that we know if Spark helps improve the code executing time.**\n",
